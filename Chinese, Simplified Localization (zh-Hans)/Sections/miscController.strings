Depending on the build type (RELEASE, DEBUG, or NOOPT) different amount of logging may be read (from least to most).\n\nTo obtain Data Hub logs, use the following command in macOS (Note that Data Hub logs do not log kernel and kext patches):\nioreg -lw0 -p IODeviceTree | grep boot-log | sort | sed 's/.*<\\(.*\\)>.*/\\1/' | xxd -r -p\n\nUEFI variable log does not include some messages and has no performance data.

Otherwise, the Builtin mode is used.\n• Apple — Apple boot management is used if available. Otherwise, the Builtin mode is used.\n\nUpon success, the External mode may entirely disable all boot management in OpenCore except for policy enforcement. In the Apple mode, it may additionally bypass policy enforcement. Refer to the OpenCanopy plugin for an example of a custom user interface.\n\nThe OpenCore built-in picker contains a set of actions chosen during the boot process. The list of supported actions is similar to Apple BDS and typically can be accessed by holding action hotkeys during the boot process.\n\nThe following actions are currently considered:\n• Default — this is the default option, and it lets the built-in OpenCore picker load the default boot option as specified in the Startup Disk preference pane.\n• ShowPicker — this option forces the OpenCore picker to be displayed. This can typically be achieved by holding the OPT key during boot. Setting ShowPicker to true will make ShowPicker the default option.\n• ResetNvram — this option erases certain UEFI variables and is normally executed by holding down the CMD+OPT+P+R key combination during boot. Another way to erase UEFI variables is to choose Reset NVRAM in the OpenCore picker. This option requires AllowNvramReset to be set to true.\n• BootApple — this options performs booting to the first Apple operating system found unless the chosen default operating system is one from Apple. Hold the X key down to choose this option.\n• BootAppleRecovery — this option performs booting into the Apple operating system recovery partition. This is either that related to the default chosen operating system, or first one found when the chosen default operating system is not from Apple or does not have a recovery partition. Hold the CMD+R key combination down to choose this option.\n\nNote 1: On non-Apple firmware KeySupport, OpenUsbKbDxe, or similar drivers are required for key handling. However, not all of the key handling functions can be implemented on several types of firmware.\n\nNote 2: In addition to OPT, OpenCore supports using both the Escape and Zero keys to enter the OpenCore picker when ShowPicker is disabled. Escape exists to support co-existence with the Apple picker (including OpenCore Apple picker mode) and to support firmware that fails to report held OPT key, as on some PS/2 keyboards. In addition, Zero is provided to support systems on which Escape is already assigned to some other pre-boot firmware feature. In systems which do not require KeySupport, pressing and holding one of these keys from after power on until the picker appears should always be successful. The same should  apply when using KeySupport mode if it is correctly configured for the system, i.e. with a long enough KeyForgetThreshold. If pressing and holding the key is not successful to reliably enter the picker, multiple repeated keypresses may be tried instead.\n\nNote 3: On Macs with problematic GOP, it may be difficult to access the Apple picker.

This includes Basic integrity checking but also attempts to build a trusted bootchain.\n\nThe vault.plist file should contain SHA-256 hashes for all files used by OpenCore. The presence of this file is highly recommended to ensure that unintentional file modifications (including filesystem corruption) do not go unnoticed. To create this file automatically, use the create_vault.sh script. Notwithstanding the underlying file system, the path names and cases between config.plist and vault.plist must match.\n\nThe vault.sig file should contain a raw 256 byte RSA-2048 signature from a SHA-256 hash of vault.plist. The signature is verified against the public key embedded into OpenCore.efi.\n\nTo embed the public key, either one of the following should be performed:\n• Provide public key during the OpenCore.efi compilation in OpenCoreVault.c file.\n• Binary patch OpenCore.efi replacing zeroes with the public key between =BEGIN OC VAULT= and ==END OC VAULT== ASCII markers.\n\nThe RSA public key 520 byte format description can be found in Chromium OS documentation.

This approach is flawed: the file is neither accessible to OpenCanopy nor to the Apple picker when FileVault 2, which is meant to be the default choice, is enabled. Therefore, OpenCanopy does not attempt supporting Apple’s approach. A volume icon file may be placed at the root of the Preboot volume for compatibility with both OpenCanopy and the Apple picker, or use the Preboot per-volume location as above with OpenCanopy as a preferred alternative to Apple’s approach.\n\nNote 2: Be aware that using a volume icon on any drive overrides the normal OpenCore picker behaviour for that drive of selecting the appropriate icon depending on whether the drive is internal or external.\n\n• 0x0002 — OC_ATTR_USE_DISK_LABEL_FILE, provides custom rendered titles for boot entries: – .disk_label (.disk_label_2x) file near bootloader for all filesystems.\n\t– <TOOL_NAME>.lbl (<TOOL_NAME>.l2x) file near tool for Tools.\n\tPrerendered labels can be generated via the disklabel utility or the bless command.

The ApECID value must also be specified to achieve Full Security.\n\nNote that enabling Apple Secure Boot is demanding on invalid configurations, faulty macOS installations, and on unsupported setups.\n\nThings to consider:\n(a) As with T2 Macs, all unsigned kernel extensions as well as several signed kernel extensions, including NVIDIA Web Drivers, cannot be installed.\n(b) The list of cached kernel extensions may be different, resulting in a need to change the list of Added or Forced kernel extensions. For example, IO80211Family cannot be injected in this case.\n(c) System volume alterations on operating systems with sealing, such as macOS 11, may result in the operating system being unbootable. Do not try to disable system volume encryption unless Apple Secure Boot is disabled.\n(d) Boot failures might occur when the platform requires certain settings, but they have not been enabled because the associated issues were not discovered earlier. Be extra careful with IgnoreInvalidFlexRatio or HashServices.\n(e) Operating systems released before Apple Secure Boot was released (e.g. macOS 10.12 or earlier), will still boot until UEFI Secure Boot is enabled. This is so because Apple Secure Boot treats these as incompatible and they are then handled by the firmware (as Microsoft Windows is).\n(f) On older CPUs (e.g. before Sandy Bridge), enabling Apple Secure Boot might cause slightly slower loading (by up to 1 second).\n(g) As the Default value will increase with time to support the latest major released operating system, it is not recommended to use the ApECID and the Default settings together.\n(h) Installing macOS with Apple Secure Boot enabled is not possible while using HFS+ target volumes. This may include HFS+ formatted drives when no spare APFS drive is available.\n\nThe installed operating system may have sometimes outdated Apple Secure Boot manifests on the Preboot partition, resulting in boot failures. This is likely to be the case when an “OCB: Apple Secure Boot prohibits this boot entry, enforcing!” message is logged.\n\nWhen this happens, either reinstall the operating system or copy the manifests (files with .im4m extension, such as boot.efi.j137.im4m) from /usr/standalone/i386 to /Volumes/Preboot/<UUID>/System/Library/CoreServices. Here, <UUID> is the system volume identifier. On HFS+ installations, the manifests should be copied to /System/Library/CoreServices on the system volume.\n\nFor more details on how to configure Apple Secure Boot with UEFI Secure Boot, refer to the UEFI Secure Boot"; ObjectID = "l6D-xS-M37"; */
